# My name is Anna vW
## My pronouns are: (she/her)

### How I get my best work done:
- My best work tends to originate from brainstorms. 
- This is usually followed by a period of wandering to find a path (searching for info, getting lost, etc).
- Then a period of intense focus.
- Sometimes I take myself to a quiet corner/ put on noise-cancelling headphones to focus best. 

### The role I usually take in a team:
- I'm good at bringing order to chaos, so tend to end up in a spokesperson or lead role. 
- I do my best to facilitate group dynamics and ensure everyone is heard. 
    - I strongly believe that the quietest people in a team are often holding the biggest gems of knowledge.  
    - Highly recommend reading: [Quiet by Susan Cain](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/quiet-the-power-of-introverts-in-a-world-that-can-t-stop-talking-susan-cain/523028?ean=9780141029191) 

### My communication style:
- Optimistic
- I love debating ideas as I believe this enables us to get to better solutions and level up our skills most. I sometimes debate myself

### What I value:
- Kindness
- Community
- Personal growth

### What people misunderstand about me:
‚õ∞Ô∏è That I'm willing to die on a hill when I express disagreement. ‚õ∞Ô∏è I'm a very optimistic person, and this means that when I have an opinion on something - it can come across as unnaturally strong. 

If you think I'm dying on a hill tell me! I'll slide down quickly! üèÇ

### How I like to get my feedback:
Frequently and often. 

I love receiving constructive feedback as I strongly believe it helps me to learn faster + become a more rounded human. 

### Technical strengths & weaknesses:
- I'm great at ideation, and turning ideans into a plan.
- I'm comfortable with a high level of uncertainty. 
- I sometimes skip over the basics when learning new concepts to tackle difficult problem.
